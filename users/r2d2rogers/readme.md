## Plans

These are some of the ideas I'd like to apply in my kemaps:

* Features
  * Macros, Tapdance,
  * Username short cut
  * make command, shift for make and flash
  * Layers, names purpose?
* Hardware
  * joysticks
  * lights
  * sounds
  * screens/displays

Starting to consolidate common useful functions for my keymaps.
